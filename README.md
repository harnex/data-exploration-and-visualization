# Part I - Exploratory analysis of the Prosper Loan Data
## by Harnex Kakandelwa

## Dataset
This dataset contains customers' loan data from the company, Prosper. The dataset covers over 100,000 loans and has information related to the listing, loan amount, number of investors, interest rate, current loan status, borrower's employment status, income and so on. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryokam/prosper-loan-data).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, the results showed that loans with high interest rates were associated with very few investors while loans with low interest rates had a very high number of investors. This seemed to support the idea that low interest rates could signify low risk thus making such loans more attractive to investors. Delving deep into this, the data suggested that loans associated with borrowers that can be classified as low risk were likely to be funded by investors regardless of the other variables considered. The results also suggested that loan amount has an influence on the level of estimated return at which lenders are more likely to fund a loan.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, my focus is on the association between interest rate, risk level and investors. Firstly, the distributions of the variables of interest are introduced and then the associations between risk level and number of investors and estimated return and number of investors are highlighted. This is then followed by an interogation of how these associations are influenced by other variables. These variables include loan term, employment status and borrower type in the case of investors and risk level.
